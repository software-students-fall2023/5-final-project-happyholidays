# Pykemon Match

## Description

Pykemon Match is a memorization matching game. At the beginning of the game, the player is presented with 8 Pokémon cards facing down. When the player clicks on a card, it flips to reveal the image of the Pokémon. The player can then click on another card. If the two cards match, they are canceled out. If the cards do not match, they flip back again. To win the game, the player must cancel out all the cards. A timer is provided to track how quickly a player can cancel out all the cards, and there is a leaderboard where the player can enter their time and compare their ranking with other players.

## Steps to run
In root directory of the app.
```bash
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```
